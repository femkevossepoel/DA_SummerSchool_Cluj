    "To test the performance of a method, we often conduct a so-called 'synthetic twin' experiment (a.k.a. inverse crime). This means that we generate a (simplified) synthetic model of the Earth, and using an (often also simplified) forward model to generate \"artificial\" observations. These artificial observations of our synthetic twin is then treated afterwards as if it would be actually observed data. Knowing our artificial world and its behaviour allows us to test a process. After successfully testing it we can apply the process to actually observed data.\n",
